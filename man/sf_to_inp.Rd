\arguments{
\item{path_options}{Name (incl. path) to a .txt file with SWMM sections. Write section name in lower case and in squared brackets. The following sections are allowed: options, report, raingages, evaporation, pollutant, landuse, buildup, washoff, coverages.}

\item{polygon_sf}{A sf object with polygons features. At least the following subcatchment related columns must be specified: Name, Outlet, Area, RouteTo.}

\item{subcatchment_typologies}{R data.frame or tibble with further subcatchment related parameters. If subcatchment_typologies is given, polygon feature has to include a column named Type. Parameters defined in subcatchment_typologies parameters are merged to subcatchments by Type.}

\item{point_sf}{A sf object with point features. At least the following junction related columns must be specified: Name, Bottom and Top or Ymax.}

\item{junction_parameters}{R data.frame or tibble with further junction related parameters (e.g. Surcharge depth).}

\item{outfall_sf}{A sf object with point features. At least the following outfall related columns must be specified: Name, Bottom, Type, Gated.}

\item{line_sf}{A sf object with line features. At least the following conduit related coulumns must be specified: Name, Length, Type, FromNode, ToNode, OutOffset, Geom1.}

\item{conduit_material}{R data.frame or tibble with further conduit related parameters (e.g. roughness). If conduit_material is given, line feature has to include a column named Material. Parameters defined in conduit_material parameters are merged to conduits by Material.}

\item{path_timeseries}{Name (incl. path) to a .dat file with a timeseries in SWMM format.}

\item{infiltration}{R data.frame or tibble with infiltration parameters related to soil properties. If infiltration is given, polygon feature has to include a column named soil. Infiltration parameters are merged to subcatchments by soil name.}

\item{pumps_sf}{A sf object with line features. All parameters must be given: Name, FromNode, ToNode, Pcurve, status, Startup, Shutoff.}

\item{path_pump_curve}{Name (incl. path) to a .txt file with pump curve information. Having the following structure: "Name of pump" "PUMP1-4" "x" "y", without header.}

\item{weirs_sf}{Alternative to path_weirs: A sf object with line features. All parameters must be given: Name, FromNode, ToNode, Type, CrestHt, Cd, Gated, EC, Cd2, Sur.}

\item{storage_sf}{A sf object with point features including storage point information. The following parameters must be given: Name, Elev, Ymax, Y0, Shape, Curve_Name, N_A, Fevap.}

\item{path_storage_curve}{Name (incl. path) to a .txt file with storage curve information. Having the following structure: "Name of storage unit" "Storage" "x" "y", without header.}
}
\value{
A list of class inp.
}
\description{
Reads sf objects and other information needed for SWMM's *.inp file and returns a list of class inp. If paths are not specified default values are taken.
