## Introduction
Model calibration or optimization is an essential part within the modelling chain 
to improve the model quality. During calibration, model parameter values are 
systematically modified to optimize an objective function, which numerically 
expresses the difference between observation and simulation data. In this 
tutorial, we walk through the required steps to autocalibrate a SWMM 
model with `swmmr`. We calibrate the _Example1.inp_ model which is shipped with the
offical SWMM executable from US EPA. For the optimization, we use the `DEoptim`
package, which provides a differential evolution optimization algorithm.

```{r load_libs}
library(swmmr)
library(DEoptim)
```

## Setup
First, model paths are defined and a simulation run is initiated with `run_swmm`
to check for errors.

```{r model_setup}
# set path to inp
# If your operating system is Windows, the Example1.inp model is usually 
# located at "C:\Users\your user name\Documents\EPA SWMM Projects\Examples".
# For convenience the Example1.inp model is also included in the swmmr package.
# Feel free to change this to your path of choice.
inp_file <- system.file("extdata", "Example1.inp", package = "swmmr", mustWork = TRUE)

# both rpt and out files are temporary files
tmp_rpt_file <- tempfile()
tmp_out_file <- tempfile()

# initiate the simulation
swmm_files <- run_swmm(
  inp = inp_file,
  rpt = tmp_rpt_file,
  out = tmp_out_file
)
```

The original output of the first simulation run is assumed to be the observation 
data. The parameter of interest is `total_runoff` at node `18`. We load the 
observation data as an `xts` object with `read_out`.

```{r obs}
obs <- read_out(
  file = swmm_files$out,
  iType = 1,
  object_name = "18",
  vIndex = 4
)[["18"]]$total_inflow
```

To keep it simple, we only calibrate the model parameter `Perc_Imperv` of 
subcatchments which are larger than 10 ha. The original parameter values are 
"50" for subcatchment "5" and "10" for subcatchment "6". The model structure is 
loaded with `read_inp`.

```{r sim_and_read}
# read model structure
inp <- read_inp(swmm_files$inp) 

# show the original parameter values
inp$subcatchments[inp$subcatchments$Area > 10, ]

```

## Goodness-of-fit criteria
To numerically evaluate the difference between observation and simulation data, 
we use the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (nse).
```{r gof}
# function calculates the goodness of fit value
# input x is a two column xts object, col1: obs, col2: sim
nse <- function(x) {
  1 - sum((x[, 1] - x[, 2]) ^ 2) / sum((x[, 1] - mean(x[, 1])) ^ 2)
}
```

## Objective function
The optimization algorithm exactly needs one function to be minimized.
Therefore, we define a function that

1. first argument takes a vector of real-valued parameters, 
2. second argument is a loaded `inp` file, containing a list of SWWM section
as tibbles and
3. takes observation data as a third argument.

The function mainly consists of three sections. First, a new parameter set 
generated from the optimization algorithm overrides the original values of the 
`inp` object. The updated `inp` object is then written to disk with `write_inp`.
Second a simulation run is performed with the new `inp` file and results 
are read with `read_out`. Finally, the goodness-of-fit value is calculated.

```{r obj_fun}
obj_fun <- function(x, inp, obs) {

  # set new parameters and update inp object
  inp$subcatchments <- transform(
    inp$subcatchments,
    Perc_Imperv = ifelse(Area > 10, x, Perc_Imperv)
  )

  # write new inp file to disk
  tmp_inp <- tempfile()
  write_inp(inp, tmp_inp)

  # run swmm with new parameter set
  swmm_files <- suppressMessages(run_swmm(tmp_inp, stdout = NULL))

  # remove files when function exits to avoid heavy disk usage
  on.exit(file.remove(unlist(swmm_files)))

  # read sim result
  sim <- read_out(
    file = swmm_files$out, # path to out file
    iType = 1, # type: node
    object_name = "18", # name of node
    vIndex = 4 # parameter at node: total inflow
  )[["18"]]$total_inflow # directly access to xts object

  # calculate goodness-of-fit
  # note: multiply by minus one to have a real min problem (nse: +1 to -Inf)
  nse(merge(obs, sim)) * -1
}

```

## Optimization
Finally, we need to config the optimization algorithm. It is required to 
provide

1. the function to be optimized 
2. parameter bounds (lower, upper)
3. a list of control parameters (useful for parallel computing or fine tuning)
4. further argument passed to the function to be minimized (here: the `Ã¬np`
object and the observation data)

```{r optim}
  set.seed(84) # to get reproducible results

  calibration_res <- DEoptim(
    fn = obj_fun, 
    lower = c(0, 0), 
    upper = c(100, 100),
    control = list(
      itermax = 50, # maximum iterations
      trace = 10, # print progress every 10th iteration
      packages = c("swmmr"), # export packages to optimization environment
      parVar = c("nse"), # export function to optimization environment
      parallelType = 0 # set to 1 to use all available cores
    ),
    inp = inp, # 'inp' object
    obs = obs # xts object containing observation data
  )

  summary(calibration_res)
```

The calibration yields `r calibration_res$optim$bestmem` as optimized parameter
values which is close to the original values.
